"It may seem that I am being a grumpy old man about this, and perhaps I am,
but the danger is that people expect an "R2-like" quantity to have all the
properties of an R2 for linear models.  It can't.  There is no way to
generalize all the properties to a much more complicated model like a GLMM."

"I would suggest that if your colleagues require R2 to "understand" the 
output from a glmm model, then they neither understand glmm models nor R2.""

"If you just need to make reviewers/colleagues happy, you could
always use the squared correlation coefficient between fitted and
observed values (I think Doug Bates has suggested this in the past).
This is certainly "an" R^2 measure, if not "the" R^2 measure."

"You can't fall in love with the one model you fit... you have to understand it."
Paraphrasing: "You have to make decisions... you have to buy into a model and check it "
